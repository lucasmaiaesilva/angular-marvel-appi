The challenge.

To create an amazing web application using this API: https://developer.marvel.com/  where you can show all of your talent!!!!
We are expecting a small web application (but feel free to apply your skills) using Material Design, following a mobile first approach.
We recommend using Angular Material, Sass, npm and gulp, but once again, feel free to use whatever you feel comfortable with!!!
